\begin{theorem}[Block Spectral Gap for Renormalized Plaquette Operators]
\label{thm:block-spectral-gap}
Let $G$ be a compact simple Lie group and consider 4D Euclidean Yang--Mills theory
on a hypercubic lattice with spacing $a$ and ultraviolet cutoff $\Lambda$.

For each RG scale $j$ in the scaling window $1 \le j \le c \log \Lambda$,
let $P_j$ denote the renormalized plaquette-block operator acting on the
physical Hilbert space $\mathcal H_j$ obtained after integrating out modes above scale $j$.

Then there exist constants $\kappa > 0$ and $j_0 < \infty$, independent of $j$ and $\Lambda$,
such that for all $j \ge j_0$,
\[
\langle \psi, P_j \psi \rangle \;\ge\; \kappa \, \|\psi\|^2
\]
for all $\psi \in \mathcal H_j$ orthogonal to the finite-dimensional gauge zero-mode subspace.

Moreover, $\kappa$ depends only on the gauge group and spacetime dimension.
\end{theorem}
