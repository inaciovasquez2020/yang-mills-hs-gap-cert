\begin{proof}
After gauge fixing, $P_j$ is a uniformly elliptic second-order operator on each
block. Its quadratic form controls the $H^1$ norm modulo gauge modes.
By the block Poincaré inequality and uniform RG ellipticity bounds,
\[
\|\psi\|_{L^2}^2 \le C \langle \psi, P_j \psi\rangle
\]
for all $\psi\in\mathcal Z_j^\perp$. Lower-order and IMS localization errors are
absorbed uniformly for $j\le c\log\Lambda$, yielding the claimed coercivity.
\end{proof}
