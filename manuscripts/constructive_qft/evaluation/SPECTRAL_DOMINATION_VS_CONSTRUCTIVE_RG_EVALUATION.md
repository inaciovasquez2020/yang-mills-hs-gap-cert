# Evaluation: Spectral Domination vs Constructive Renormalization (4D SU(2))

## Executive Conclusion

Spectral domination machinery provides strong **finite-volume coercive control** and
explicit large-field barriers, but **does not currently bypass** the known
nonperturbative constructive RG obstruction in 4D Yang–Mills.

It strengthens structural clarity but does not replace multiscale renormalization control.

# I. What Spectral Domination Achieves

The repository establishes:

1. Explicit electric coercivity:
   H_{a,Λ} ≥ γ(a)(I − P_0)

2. Volume-independent lower bounds.

3. Explicit SU(2) large-field barrier:
   ||U − I|| ≥ δ ⇒ magnetic cost ≥ δ²/2.

4. Thermodynamic limit stability of spectral gap.

5. Exponential clustering derived from spectral gap.

These results are nonperturbative and operator-theoretic.

They eliminate:
- Boundary soft modes
- Gauge-kernel ambiguities
- Large-field collapse
- Finite-volume spectral leakage

This is stronger than heuristic lattice physics arguments.

# II. Where Constructive RG Is Hard

Constructive 4D Yang–Mills requires:

A. Uniform multiscale control of renormalization flow  
B. Tightness of measures as a → 0  
C. Extraction of interacting continuum Schwinger functions  
D. Verification of OS axioms in the limit  
E. Identification of a strictly positive physical mass  

Balaban's program achieved partial small-coupling control but did not close:

- Infinite-scale uniform bounds
- Full tightness + continuum extraction

# III. Does Spectral Domination Provide New Leverage?

## 1. On Large-Field Control

YES — it provides explicit deterministic barriers,
where classical RG relies heavily on probabilistic suppression.

This strengthens the large-field sector.

However, large-field suppression was not the main obstruction in 4D.

---

## 2. On Small-Field / Marginal Flow Control

NO — spectral domination does not currently control:

- Running of marginal operators
- Counterterm flow
- Renormalized coupling stabilization

Those require multiscale cluster expansions or RG fixed-point analysis.

Spectral coercivity does not constrain β-function flow directly.

---

## 3. On Tightness of Measures

NO — operator lower bounds do not imply
tightness of Schwinger functions under a → 0.

Tightness requires uniform control of moments of gauge fields across scales.

This remains unsolved in 4D.

---

## 4. On Continuum Limit Extraction

PARTIAL — spectral gap helps ensure mass does not vanish,
but does not construct the continuum interacting measure.

Continuum construction still depends on renormalization control.

---

# IV. Precise Remaining Gap

The unsolved component is:

Uniform multiscale coercive RG control (kZx):

- Reflection positivity preserved under blocking
- Uniform control of effective actions
- Uniform spectral gap after infinitely many blocking steps
- Identification of renormalized mass scale

Spectral domination helps finite-scale coercivity,
but does not yet prove uniform control across infinite scales.

# V. Final Assessment

Spectral domination:

✔ Closes operator-theoretic lattice obstruction  
✔ Strengthens large-field deterministic control  
✔ Clarifies structural rigidity mechanism  
✔ Reduces the Clay problem to a single RG obstruction (kZx)

But:

✘ Does not currently solve nonperturbative 4D constructive RG  
✘ Does not replace multiscale renormalization machinery  
✘ Does not yet yield continuum Schwinger functions

# VI. Strategic Interpretation

The program is now reduced to:

Prove uniform multiscale RG coercivity (kZx).

This is equivalent in difficulty to the remaining Clay problem.

No known existing method currently proves kZx in 4D.
