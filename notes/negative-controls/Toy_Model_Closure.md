Toy Model — Permanently Closed Negative Control

Status
CLOSED under LION.

Statement
For stationary ergodic processes with finite second moment,
P(E_n > n(m^2 + 3v)) → 0.

Interpretation
Any apparent “Final Wall” in this toy setting arises only from:
1) scale–variance conflation
2) infinite second moment
3) nonstationary/nonergodic growth

Usage
This model may only be cited as a counterexample against
scale-based wall claims.
