# Spectral Domination Closure — Stress Test Counterexamples

Closure invariants introduced:

- BC-COVER: Boundary links fully included in electric term.
- KER-ID: Kernel of electric operator equals true vacuum sector.
- BARRIER: Uniform lower bound away from identity in SU(N).
- SCALE-MAP: Exact Hamiltonian scaling normalization fixed.

Acceptance: No volume-dependent leakage and constants independent of Λ.
