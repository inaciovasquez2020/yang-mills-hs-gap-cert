Continuum construction entry ticket

Goal: a single accepted construction pathway that yields
- Euclidean measure with OS positivity
- reconstruction of Hilbert space and Hamiltonian
- gauge invariance on the physical subspace
- controlled removal of the UV cutoff

Deliverables required in this repository:
A. Precise model object (lattice action, measure, boundary conditions, scaling)
B. OS domain and reflection positivity statement
C. Reconstruction map and identification of H
D. Cutoff-removal statement with uniform bounds used later in the gap proof
