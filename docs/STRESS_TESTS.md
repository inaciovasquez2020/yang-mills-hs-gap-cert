Stress-Test Families

Purpose
Stress tests explore parameter regimes beyond the certified set
to probe stability and scaling behavior of the HS-gap inequality.

Contents
Files in stress/YM_HS_GAP_STRESS_*.json are auto-generated families
with increasing volume and cutoff.

Policy
- Stress tests are executable but non-binding
- CI does not gate on stress results
- Certified results live only in certs/

Interpretation
Consistent decay across stress families supports robustness
but does not replace certified artifacts.
