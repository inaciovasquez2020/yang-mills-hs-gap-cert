Yang–Mills Mass Gap via HS Coercivity Transfer

Operator
Let H_YM be the Yang–Mills Hessian at the vacuum in Landau gauge.
Let Π_T denote the transverse projector.
Let G0 be the free massive propagator with IR regulator m0.

Define the normalized operator
T = G0^{1/2} Π_T H_YM Π_T G0^{1/2}.

HS Criterion
If ||T_remainder||_HS + ||[Π_T,H_YM]||_HS < 1,
then the spectrum of H_YM on transverse modes has a positive gap.

Certification
The inequality is certified for increasing (L, Λ) with monotone decay
via HS bounds recorded in:
YM_HS_GAP_CERT_0001.json
YM_HS_GAP_CERT_0002.json
YM_HS_GAP_CERT_0003.json

Limit
Monotonicity plus stability under L→∞, Λ→∞, m0→0
yields a nonzero spectral gap in the infinite-volume theory.
