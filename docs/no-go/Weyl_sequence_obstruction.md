Weyl-Sequence Obstruction (Discrete Laplacian Prototype)

Let Δ_L be the 1D periodic discrete Laplacian on Z/LZ.
Then the smallest positive eigenvalue satisfies
lambda_1(Δ_L) = 4 sin^2(pi/L) ~ (2pi/L)^2 as L -> infinity.

Hence there exists a sequence of unit vectors v_L orthogonal to constants with
<v_L, Δ_L v_L> -> 0 as L -> infinity.

Therefore any attempt to obtain an L-uniform spectral gap from the pure quadratic Laplacian
fails: the quadratic operator admits a Weyl sequence at the bottom of the spectrum.
