Nonabelian Domination Wall (NDW)

Status: CANDIDATE FINAL WALL

Statement:
There exists no uniform domination inequality reducing 4D nonabelian Yang–Mills
to a massive Gaussian reference measure while preserving:
(1) Osterwalder–Schrader positivity,
(2) gauge invariance,
(3) bounded admissibility of the deformation.

Equivalently, there is no m>0, C<∞ such that for all gauge-invariant observables F
supported in a slab,
⟨F⟩_YM ≤ C ⟨|F|⟩_Gauss,m
uniformly in volume and scale.

Interface Lemma (Open):
Prove or refute existence of a Gaussian domination inequality for YM₄.
