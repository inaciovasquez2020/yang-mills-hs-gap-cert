GOE Interface Lemma (Gauge-Orbit Entropy Obstruction)

Goal:
Provide a checkable obstruction to Gaussian domination in nonabelian YM₄.

Objects:
- Finite-volume lattice gauge system with gauge group SU(N), OS reflection positivity, gauge invariance.
- Reflection plane with boundary slab sigma-algebra B and past/future sigma-algebras P,F.

Lemma (GOE):
There exists c>0 such that
I(Orbit(P); Orbit(F) | Orbit(B)) ≥ c · Area(∂)
uniformly in volume/scale.

Implication:
GOE forbids uniform domination by any massive Gaussian reference while preserving OS positivity and bounded admissibility.

Proof obligation:
Define Orbit(·) as the sigma-algebra of gauge-orbit equivalence classes and show the area-law lower bound on conditional mutual information.
