GOE restricted-regime attack plan

Targets:
(1) Strong-coupling lattice gauge theory with finite nonabelian group (S3 as SU(2)-truncation proxy)
(2) Heat-kernel-type plaquette weight via a class function exp(beta * chi(g_p))
(3) Compute conditional mutual information I(Past;Future | Boundary) for small reflection-symmetric lattices
(4) Search for:
    - area-scaling lower bounds (evidence for GOE)
    - vanishing CMI regimes (refutation candidates)

This folder contains brute-force exact enumeration tests for tiny lattices.
