Strong-coupling GOE test summary (finite group S3):

- Exact enumeration on 2x2 reflection-symmetric lattice
- Heat-kernel-type plaquette weight exp(beta * chi2)
- Conditional mutual information I(P;F|B) computed exactly

Observed:
- I(P;F|B) > 0 for all beta in [0,6]
- No near-zero or cancellation regime found
- Clear separation from abelian Z2 behavior

Interpretation:
- No refutation of GOE in strongest accessible nonabelian regime
