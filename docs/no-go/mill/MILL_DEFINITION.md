Mill Input (Orbit Mixing Lower Bound)

Mill quantifies irreducible nonabelian orbit mixing across scales.
Formally, Mill asserts a uniform lower bound on entropy production per
RG step induced by noncommutativity of gauge orbits.

Mill := liminf_{scale→∞} (entropy created per coarse-graining step)

Goal: prove Mill > 0 under OS positivity.
