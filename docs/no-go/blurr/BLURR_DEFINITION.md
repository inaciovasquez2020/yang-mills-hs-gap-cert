Blurr Input (Local Test Definition)

Blurr quantifies controlled coarse-graining of gauge-orbit information:
a smoothing operator B_ε acting on boundary data such that
conditional mutual information satisfies

I(P;F|B_ε) ≥ c(ε) · Area(P|F)

Goal: test whether blurring can suppress GOE without violating OS positivity.
