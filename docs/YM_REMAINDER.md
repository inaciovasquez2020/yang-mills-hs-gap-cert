Yang–Mills remainder checklist (operational)

1. Continuum entry ticket
- Provide (or cite) a single construction pathway with OS positivity, gauge invariance, Hamiltonian existence, cutoff removal.
- Output artifact: docs/CONTINUUM_CONSTRUCTION.md

2. Spectral floor target
- State the exact operator, domain, vacuum sector, orthogonality condition.
- Output artifact: SPECTRAL_TARGET.md

3. Infrared exclusion taxonomy
- Enumerate all candidate low-energy sequences not covered by semiclassics.
- Output artifact: IR_OBSTRUCTIONS.md

4. Operator-level RG control
- Define the operator-norm invariants required along the flow.
- Output artifact: RG_OPERATOR_INVARIANTS.md

5. One hard mechanism
- Either a coercive inequality or an explicit gapless mechanism.
- Output artifact: MECHANISM.md
