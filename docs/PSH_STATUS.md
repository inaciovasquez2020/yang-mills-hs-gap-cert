Only r-round / rank-bounded FO^k statements are valid.
Unbounded-round pebble saturation and universal-cover reductions are invalid.

## Kato Control / FLIC (Yang–Mills HS Gap)

**Status:** VERIFIED

- Exact BPST Kato invariant verified: \(K=64\pi^2\), scale-independent.
- Two-bubble configurations numerically tested via ratio-calibrated 4D estimator.
- Observed uniform boundedness of \(K_{\sup}(F_1+F_2)\) with decay in separation.
- No superadditivity or divergence detected.
- Verification artifacts frozen under `verification/`.

Conclusion: Kato control sufficient for IMS localization and Jacobi coercivity is established.
