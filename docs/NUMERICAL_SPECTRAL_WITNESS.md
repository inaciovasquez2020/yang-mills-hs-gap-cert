Numerical Witness Summary

Operator: Reduced Yang–Mills radial operator on S^4
Method: Quadratic-form coercivity + stable Rayleigh–Ritz lower bound
Parameters tested: k ∈ {1,2,3}, ℓ ∈ {0,1,2,3}

Results:
- Rayleigh quadratic form strictly positive for all tested modes
- Ritz lower bound stable across basis sizes m ∈ {6,8,10,12}
- Uniform positivity margin > 1.0 observed

Status:
Numerical witness only. Not a proof.
