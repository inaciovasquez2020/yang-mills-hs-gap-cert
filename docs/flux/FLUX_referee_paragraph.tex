\paragraph{Continuum–Stability Interface (FLUX).}
The sole interface between the lattice-level obstruction and the continuum
Yang--Mills theory is a stability requirement under removal of the ultraviolet
cutoff.  FLUX isolates this interface by postulating a separating family of
local, gauge-invariant flux observables with uniform exponential moment bounds
and compatibility with Osterwalder--Schrader reflection positivity.  These
conditions imply tightness of the admissible lattice measures and ensure that
orbit-entropy functionals are lower semicontinuous under weak convergence.
Consequently, any entropy obstruction verified uniformly at finite cutoff
persists in the continuum limit.  FLUX introduces no new dynamics or
invariants; it is a continuity-of-limits condition that prevents entropy
collapse as the lattice spacing tends to zero.
