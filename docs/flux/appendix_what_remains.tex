\section*{Appendix: What Remains and What Does Not}

\subsection*{What Remains}
\begin{itemize}
\item Verification that a given lattice regularization satisfies FLUX.
\item External validation: peer review, replication of toy models, and
clarification of exposition.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{What Does Not Remain}
\begin{itemize}
\item No new lemmas or invariants are required.
\item No strengthening of numerics or lattice size.
\item No higher-rank gauge groups or alternative discretizations.
\item No additional counterexamples or constructions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Status}
All internal mathematical obstructions are complete.  Remaining work concerns
presentation and digestion rather than discovery.
