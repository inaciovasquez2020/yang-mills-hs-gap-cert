Strong Coupling Stage 1 Checkpoint

Status:
- L=6: stable short-distance correlator, m_eff ≈ 0.70
- Reflection positivity (Toeplitz test): PASS
- L=8: volume scaling verified, signal-to-noise collapse identified
- No continuum claims made
- Infrastructure validated

Next step (not yet executed):
- Increase statistics at L=8
- Introduce operator smearing for stability
