## ALSTAR (Axiom of Locality Separation via Time–RG)

`papers/alstar/` contains the ALSTAR paper:

**ALSTAR: Rigid–Precise–Localized–Flexible Dynamics in Lattice Yang–Mills**

This document formalizes a structural obstruction to purely locality-based,
coercive approaches to the Yang–Mills mass gap. It does **not** claim a positive
resolution of the mass gap. Instead, it proves a dichotomy:

- Either locality persists at logarithmic scales, implying uniform
  Lieb–Robinson bounds and contradicting verified two-bubble instabilities; or
- Locality must fail at superlogarithmic scales, forcing any viable mechanism
  to be genuinely nonlocal (e.g. RG-mediated).

ALSTAR functions as a **negative / exclusion result** within this repository,
supporting the scope and interpretation of finalized certificates.
