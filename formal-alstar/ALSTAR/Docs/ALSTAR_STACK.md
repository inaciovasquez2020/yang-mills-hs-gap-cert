ALSTAR Stack — REQ Route (Bubble Packing Program)
I. Logical Bridge
TwoBubbleLowerBound A
⟹ NonCoercive A
⟹ ¬Coercive A
This is the structural obstruction layer:
linear energy growth contradicts coercive/log-type upper control.
II. Main Theorem (Current Formal Endpoint)
ALSTAR_Main:
ReflectionPositive A →
SelfAdjoint A →
GapOnPhys A →
¬Coercive A
Factored as:
RP + SA + Gap
⟹ REQ
⟹ BubblePackingLinear
⟹ TwoBubbleLowerBound
⟹ NonCoercive
⟹ ¬Coercive
III. Current Axiomatic Scaffolding
The following remain axioms/placeholders:
packing_linear
per_bubble_energy_lb
R_lower_bounds_packed_energy
TwoBubble_implies_NonCoercive
RP_SA_Gap_implies_packing_axioms
These are the true mathematical core.
IV. Hard Mathematics to Remove Scaffolding
To fully de-axiomatize REQ, prove:
Geometric Bubble Separation
⇒ packing_linear
Localized Spectral Gap
⇒ per_bubble_energy_lb
Energy Additivity + Orthogonality
⇒ R_lower_bounds_packed_energy
Quantitative Growth vs Log Bound Contradiction
⇒ TwoBubble_implies_NonCoercive
Constructive RG / Spectral Argument
⇒ RP_SA_Gap_implies_packing_axioms
V. Strategic Interpretation
The program reduces the Yang–Mills obstruction to:
Linear-in-n energy accumulation
    vs
Logarithmic coercive upper bounds
Everything now hinges on proving
geometric packing + spectral lower bounds
inside the physical sector.
