Main Theorem
ALSTAR_Main:
RP A → SA A → GapOnPhys A → ¬Coercive A
Remaining Hard Mathematics (Non-Axiomatic Targets)
To remove scaffolding:
Prove packing_linear from geometric bubble separation.
Prove per_bubble_energy_lb from spectral gap on localized sector.
Prove R_lower_bounds_packed_energy via additivity + orthogonality.
Prove TwoBubble_implies_NonCoercive analytically.
Replace RP_SA_Gap_implies_packing_axioms with constructive argument.
