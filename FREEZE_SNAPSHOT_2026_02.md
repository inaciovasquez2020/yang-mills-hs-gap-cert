# YM Closure Snapshot — February 2026

Tag: ym-closure-batch-2026-02

## Scope
This snapshot freezes:
- SU(2) strong-coupling experiments
- RG blocking scaling suite
- Spectral gap diagnostics
- Closure consistency tests

## Structural Status
- Numerical pipeline operational
- RG scaling diagnostics reproducible
- Gap heuristics implemented
- Continuum consistency tests present

## What This Snapshot Is
A computational + structural milestone.

## What This Snapshot Is Not
- Not a finalized mass-gap proof
- Not a closed continuum argument
- Not a publication-ready reduction

## Invariant Being Protected
Local structure under blocking preserves controlled spectral behavior
within tested regimes.

Future changes must not silently break:
- RG scaling consistency
- Spectral monotonicity behavior
- Transcript/bounded-information assumptions
