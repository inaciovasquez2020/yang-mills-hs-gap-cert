Status: Frozen numerical witness

This directory contains numerical witnesses for coercivity of the reduced
Yang–Mills operator via quadratic-form estimates and stable Rayleigh–Ritz
lower bounds.

These tests are evidentiary and not a proof.
No further modifications should be made without bumping the witness tag.
