Scale-to-Invariant Threshold Replacement Rule

Forbidden
Any threshold constructed from a proxy scale parameter that is not a law invariant.

Required
Compute invariant mean m_Λ and invariant second moment v_Λ from the actual law
(empirical or certified), and construct thresholds exclusively from these quantities.

This rule is mandatory for all Flux/ALSTAR domination claims.
