LION — Law-Invariant Normalization Axiom (Flux/ALSTAR)

For each scale Λ and observable O_Λ generated under the physical/RG law, define
m_Λ := E[O_Λ]
v_Λ := Var(O_Λ) or a certified second-moment surrogate when finite.

Axiom (LION-Admissibility)
A domination / “Final Wall” threshold Θ_Λ is admissible only if it is a function of
law invariants (m_Λ, v_Λ) computed from the actual law of O_Λ.

Reparameterization Invariance
If two parameterizations induce the same law for O_Λ, admissible thresholds coincide.

Infinite-Variance Exclusion
If E[O_Λ²] = ∞ and no certified second-moment surrogate exists, any variance-based
domination statement is inadmissible.
