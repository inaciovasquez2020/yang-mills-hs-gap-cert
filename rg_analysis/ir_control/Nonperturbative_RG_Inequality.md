Nonperturbative RG Control Inequality

Goal:
Bound effective cubic vertex norm uniformly for Λ >= μ.

Let Γ_Λ^(3) denote the 1PI effective cubic vertex
at scale Λ.

Target inequality:

|| Γ_Λ^(3) ||_{H0-form} <= C g(Λ)

uniformly for Λ >= μ.

RG flow equation (schematic Polchinski form):

∂_Λ Γ_Λ^(3)
= Functional[Γ_Λ^(3), Γ_Λ^(4)]

Heuristic bound structure:

d/d log Λ || Γ_Λ^(3) ||
<= -β0 g(Λ)^2 || Γ_Λ^(3) || + C g(Λ)^3

If true, Grönwall inequality gives:

|| Γ_Λ^(3) || <= C g(Λ)

for Λ >= μ.

Obstruction condition:

If effective coupling grows superlinearly
or anomalous dimension γ > 1,
then bound fails and Mourre inequality collapses.

Reduction statement:

Mass gap via Mourre ⇔
Uniform RG inequality for effective vertex.
