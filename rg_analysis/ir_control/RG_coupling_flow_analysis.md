Direct constructive RG bound — infrared control layer

Goal:
Establish uniform quadratic-form bounds for V_Λ and i[V_Λ, A]
for Λ >= μ > 0.

Running coupling (one-loop structure):

β(g) = -β0 g^3 + O(g^5)

g(Λ)^2 ≈ 1 / (β0 log(Λ / Λ_QCD))

Implications:
1. g(Λ) bounded for Λ >= μ > Λ_QCD
2. g(Λ) small in UV
3. Potential IR growth only near confinement scale

Uniformity region:
Fix μ > Λ_QCD.
Prove bounds for Λ >= μ.

Effective Hamiltonian form:

H_Λ = H0 + g(Λ) V3 + g(Λ)^2 V4 + irrelevant terms

Irrelevant operators are power-suppressed by Λ^{-2}
and hence H0-form small.

Required estimates:

|<ψ, V3 ψ>| <= ε <ψ, H0 ψ> + C(ε) ||ψ||^2
|<ψ, i[V3, A] ψ>| <= ε <ψ, H0 ψ> + C(ε) ||ψ||^2

If satisfied uniformly for Λ >= μ,
then Mourre form control reduces to
uniform boundedness of g(Λ) on that region.

Open obstruction:
Nonperturbative growth of effective coupling
or anomalous dimension enhancement of V3.
