Coercive reformulation of C2

Original form bound:

|<ψ, i[V, A] ψ>| <= a_A <ψ, H0 ψ> + b_A ||ψ||^2

Full Mourre inequality:

<ψ, i[H, A] ψ> >= c <ψ, H0 ψ> - C ||ψ||^2

Interpretation:

Define defect functional

D(ψ) = <ψ, H ψ> - κ <ψ, H0 ψ>

Target coercivity:

D(ψ) >= m ||ψ||^2

Structural meaning:

Interaction energy cannot concentrate
without proportional quadratic energy cost.

Rigidity analogue:

Local defect under scaling generator A
forces global spectral lower bound.

Reduction:

All structure reduces to verifying
uniform infrared control of effective vertices.
