S^4 stereographic chart (from north pole to R^4):

Volume form:
dvol_{S^4} = (2/(1+|x|^2))^4 dx.

Geodesic kernel conversion (schematic):
d_{S^4}(x,y) relates to |x-y| with conformal factors.
A practical numeric port multiplies integrands by the conformal weights
coming from the metric and volume form, then uses Euclidean sampling in R^4.

This file records the conversion ingredients needed to port the Kato test
from R^4 to S^4 in stereographic coordinates.
