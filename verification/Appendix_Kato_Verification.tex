\section*{Appendix D: Numerical Verification of the Kato Invariant}

We verify the scale-invariant Kato quantity for the BPST instanton
\[
K = \int_{\mathbb R^4} \frac{|F_{A_\lambda}(y)|^2}{|y|^2}\,dy = 64\pi^2,
\]
independent of the scale parameter \(\lambda>0\).

Using the change of variables \(y=\lambda u\), the integral reduces to
\[
K = 2\pi^2 \int_0^\infty \frac{192\,u}{(1+u^2)^4}\,du,
\]
which is manifestly scale invariant.

A numerical quadrature in the scale-free variable \(u\) confirms convergence to
\(64\pi^2\) with uniform accuracy across several decades of \(\lambda\).
Naïve discretizations in the physical variable \(r\) or with fixed cutoffs
produce artificial divergences; these are eliminated by the invariant formulation above.
