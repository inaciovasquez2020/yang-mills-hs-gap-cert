# Counterexamples

This directory contains negative instances and stress-tests used to falsify
over-strong locality/precision claims and to validate certificate scope.

Rules:
- No claim of mass gap proof is made here.
- Items are classified as either:
  (i) Explicit construction,
  (ii) Verified empirical / numerical reproduction,
  (iii) Formal incompatibility witness (assumption -> contradiction).

Each counterexample must include:
- a short statement of the target claim it refutes,
- the minimal assumptions used,
- the witness object (construction/data/code),
- a reproducible verification command.
