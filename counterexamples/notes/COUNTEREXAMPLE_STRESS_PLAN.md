Counterexample stress test plan

Goal
Search for mechanisms that violate at least one of:
[U,L]=0, OS semigroup positivity, uniform Mourre lower bound, coercivity H >= kappa L

Stress families
S1 Large-scale delocalized flux-tube candidates
S2 Topological sector tunneling candidates
S3 Near-zero modes from coarse graining mismatch
S4 Boundary-driven soft modes in finite volume
S5 Nonlocal RG maps that scramble L

Deliverables
