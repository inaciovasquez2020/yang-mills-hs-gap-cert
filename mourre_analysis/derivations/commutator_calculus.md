Commutator calculus skeleton

Assume a Hamiltonian decomposition
H_ren = H0 + V
L = H0

Goal
i[H_ren, A] = i[H0, A] + i[V, A]
Show i[H0, A] >= 2L - Err
Show ||i[V, A]|| <= C0
Conclude i[H_ren, A] >= (2 - eps)L - C0 1

Required inputs
Definition of A and its action on E and B
Discrete Leibniz rules
Uniform bounds for counterterms and their commutators

Placeholders for explicit formulas
Define lattice A as generator of scaling on link variables via derivations
Define commutators via derivations on the algebra of cylindrical functions
