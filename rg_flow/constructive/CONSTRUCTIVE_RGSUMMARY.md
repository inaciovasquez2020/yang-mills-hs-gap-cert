Constructive RG connection summary

Objective
Relate RG monotonicity lemma to existing constructive field theory results.

Known structures
1. Asymptotic freedom (Gross–Wilczek, Politzer)
2. Perturbative beta function rigor (Dimock, Rivasseau in lower dimensions)
3. Lattice gauge constructive bounds partial in 2D, incomplete in 4D

Gap
Full 4D nonperturbative control of Yang–Mills RG trajectory remains unproven.

Strategy
Bridge monotonicity lemma to:
- Cluster expansion control
- Multiscale decomposition bounds
- Uniform stability of effective action coefficients

Deliverable
Explicit statement of required nonperturbative beta bound.
