Operator-level RG control

Goal: define an operator-norm invariant I(Λ) along a renormalization flow such that
- I(Λ) controls long-range operator tails
- I(Λ) controls spectral floor degradation
- I(Λ) has a monotonicity or stability bound as Λ -> ∞

Deliverables:
- precise definition of I(Λ)
- required inequalities along the RG map
- interface with ym/SPECTRAL_TARGET.md
