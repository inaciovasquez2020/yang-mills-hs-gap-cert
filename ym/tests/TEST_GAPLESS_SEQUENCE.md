Candidate states:
Soft-gluon coherent states:
ψ_f := exp(i ∫ A_i^a(x) f_i^a(x) dx) Ω

Constraints:
- f divergence-free (Gauss law)
- gauge-invariant dressing

Energy:
E(f) = <ψ_f, H ψ_f>

Test:
Choose f_n with ||f_n||=1, support scale → ∞,
and compute E(f_n).

If E(f_n) → 0 while ψ_f remains physical, record as Option B witness.
