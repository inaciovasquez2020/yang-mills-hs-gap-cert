Proposed axiom (choose one):

Axiom (Uniform Wilson-loop gap):
∃ m_*>0 such that the transfer matrix restricted to the plaquette Wilson-loop sector
has spectral gap ≥ m_* uniformly in volume and cutoff.

Implication:
⇒ exponential clustering for W_P
⇒ IR exclusion
⇒ mass gap.

Status:
To be accepted as conditional closure if consistent with all known limits.
