Pulse -> Noncoercive bridge test protocol

Goal
Establish a checkable chain from Pulse bounds to a quantitative upper bound on I(Lambda).

Artifacts
ym/proofs/PULSE_TO_NONCOERCIVE_PROOF.tex

Acceptance
A complete proof file replaces the Bridge Target sketch with fully stated lemmas and proofs,
including explicit constants and hypotheses matching the certification schema.
