Witness intake (numerical/analytic)

Populate exactly one of:
(1) Wilson-loop channel eigenvalue bound
(2) Ball covariant-Laplacian counterexample or uniform lower bound
(3) One-step RG comparison inequality for I(Λ)
(4) Explicit gapless physical state family with energy computation
(5) New axiom/estimate implying one of (1)-(3)

Then run: python3 scripts/verify_witness.py witness/WITNESS.json
