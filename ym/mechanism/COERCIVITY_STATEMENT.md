Target coercive inequality

Let H be the reconstructed Yang–Mills Hamiltonian on H_phys.
Let Ω be the vacuum.

Goal:
∃ m > 0 such that
⟨ψ, H ψ⟩ ≥ m ||ψ||^2
for all ψ ⟂ Ω

Uniformity:
- independent of volume
- stable under cutoff removal

Strategy:
Reduce to a localized spectral inequality plus an infrared exclusion bound.
