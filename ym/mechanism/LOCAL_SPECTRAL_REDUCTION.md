Local spectral reduction

Define a partition of unity {χ_R} indexed by scale R.

Decomposition:
⟨ψ, H ψ⟩ = Σ_R ⟨χ_R ψ, H χ_R ψ⟩ - error(R)

Required:
1. Lower bound ⟨φ, H φ⟩ ≥ c ||φ||^2 for all φ supported at scale R
2. Error(R) ≤ ε(R) ||ψ||^2 with ε(R) → 0

Conclusion:
Choose R large so that c - ε(R) > 0.
