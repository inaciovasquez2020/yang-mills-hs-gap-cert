Infrared obstruction class

Goal: exclude any sequence psi_n in H_phys with
E_n = ⟨psi_n, H psi_n⟩ / ||psi_n||^2 -> 0
that is not captured by:
- perturbative small-field sector
- instanton or finite-dimensional moduli sectors
- finite-bubble decompositions

Deliverable:
- explicit taxonomy of candidate delocalized states
- for each class: required exclusion lemma or explicit counterexample channel
