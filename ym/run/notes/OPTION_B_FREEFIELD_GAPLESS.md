Option B (Conditional): gapless family in a quadratic/massless regime.

Assume the physical Hamiltonian admits an effective quadratic sector with dispersion ω(k)=|k|
for some gauge-invariant physical excitation channel.

Pick k_n with |k_n| -> 0, and normalized one-particle states ψ_n in that channel.

Then:
E_n = <ψ_n, H ψ_n> = ω(k_n) -> 0.

This is a valid gapless witness only if such a massless channel exists in the nonperturbative YM continuum.
