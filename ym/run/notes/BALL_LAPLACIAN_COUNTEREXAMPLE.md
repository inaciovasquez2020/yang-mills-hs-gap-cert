Counterexample to a uniform (in R) Dirichlet lower bound for -Δ_A on expanding balls:

Background:
A ≡ 0.

Domain:
B_R (or cube [-R,R]^3 with Dirichlet boundary).

Then:
λ1(A,R) = λ1(0,R) ~ c/R^2 → 0 as R→∞.

Hence:
inf_R λ1(A,R) = 0.

This shows that any "ball coercivity" bound independent of R cannot hold for the bare covariant Laplacian alone;
a strictly positive mass term / spectral floor must enter elsewhere (e.g., from the full Hamiltonian or constraints).
