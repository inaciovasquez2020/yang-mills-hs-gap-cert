RG one-step bound (explicit constants):

Assume (physical sector) self-adjoint matrices H_L and H_Lb satisfy:
H_Lb = H_L + V, with operator norm ||V|| <= eps.

Then for the spectral infimum above the vacuum (finite-dimensional proxy):
I(Lb) >= I(L) - eps.

This is a direct Weyl/variational bound:
inf_{psi ⟂ Ω} <psi, H_Lb psi> >= inf_{psi ⟂ Ω} <psi, H_L psi> - ||V||.
