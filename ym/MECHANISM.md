One hard mechanism

Option A: coercive inequality
Provide a single inequality that implies the spectral floor in SPECTRAL_TARGET.md.

Option B: gapless mechanism
Provide an explicit construction of states psi_n with energy -> 0 that survive all constraints in IR_OBSTRUCTIONS.md and the continuum entry ticket.

Deliverable:
- exact statement
- dependency list
- pass/fail criteria
