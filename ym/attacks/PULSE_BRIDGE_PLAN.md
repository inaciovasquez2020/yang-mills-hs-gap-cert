Pulse bridge plan

Target
Discharge the Lean axiom pulse_logbound_implies_noncoercive_target by proving the Bridge Target theorem:
Pulse regime implies a gapless sequence I(Lambda_j)->0.

Work units
1) Specify Pulse invariant in operator norm form sufficient for transfer-matrix truncation
2) Prove DT convergence bound for T_Lambda on physical sector
3) Convert DT bound to Rayleigh quotient bound for H_Lambda
4) Verify RG stability interface needed to iterate across scales
5) Match hypotheses to the Lean Schema A.R growth object

Exit criteria
A proof replaces the axiom with a theorem and lake build succeeds with no axioms remaining in PulseBridge chain
