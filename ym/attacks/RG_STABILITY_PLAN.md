Goal: prove RG monotonicity/stability of I(Λ) := inf{<ψ,H_Λψ>: ||ψ||=1, ψ ⟂ Ω_Λ}.

Target:
inf_{Λ≥Λ0} I(Λ) ≥ m_* > 0
or stability inequality I(Λ') ≥ I(Λ) - η(Λ,Λ') with sup_{Λ'≥Λ} η(Λ,Λ')→0.

Route A (operator-norm RG invariants):
1. Define I(Λ) and also a local tail norm J(Λ) controlling long-range operator generation.
2. Prove RG step inequality: I(Λ/b) ≥ I(Λ) - C·J(Λ).
3. Prove J(Λ) ≤ ε(Λ) with ε(Λ)→0 (Pulse/cluster expansion type bound).
4. Conclude I(Λ) Cauchy-stable and bounded below.

Route B (comparison of transfer matrices):
1. Show T_Λ' is a CP map perturbation of T_Λ on the physical sector.
2. Apply perturbation bounds for the second eigenvalue to control the gap.

Degradation route:
Exhibit an RG mechanism producing a tower of near-vacuum states with energies shrinking with Λ.
