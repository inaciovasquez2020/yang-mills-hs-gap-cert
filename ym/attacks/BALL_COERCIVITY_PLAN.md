Goal: establish a ball-localized coercivity (Poincaré-type) inequality for YM energy density.

Model:
H = ∫ h(x) dx,  h(x) ≈ 1/2(E^2 + B^2) + renormalization terms, gauge-fixed then projected.

Target (ball coercivity):
∃ R0,m_loc>0 such that for all R≥R0 and all φ ⟂ Ω supported in B_R,
<φ,Hφ> ≥ m_loc ||φ||^2.

Route A (Gauss law + Dirichlet energy):
1. Choose a gauge (temporal/Coulomb) and identify the physical subspace (Gauss constraint).
2. Prove a Poincaré inequality for the covariant Laplacian on B_R with Dirichlet boundary.
3. Control commutator/constraint terms and show the physical projection does not destroy coercivity.

Disproof route:
Construct approximate zero-modes localized in large balls with energy → 0 while remaining physical.
