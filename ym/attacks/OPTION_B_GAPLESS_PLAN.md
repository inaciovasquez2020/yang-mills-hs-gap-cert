Option B: construct an explicit admissible gapless sequence.

Goal:
Find ψ_n ⟂ Ω with ||ψ_n||=1 and <ψ_n,Hψ_n> → 0,
compatible with gauge invariance, OS reconstruction, and cutoff removal.

Candidates to test:
1. Delocalized flux-tube / string-like states with tension → 0 under RG.
2. Large-scale gauge transformations producing near-zero energy excitations (must remain physical).
3. Soft-gluon coherent states (must survive Gauss law and renormalization).
4. Topological sector mixing producing vanishing splitting.

Pass criteria:
- state is gauge-invariant (physical)
- energy computed in the reconstructed Hamiltonian sense
- survives continuum limit without leaving the model class
