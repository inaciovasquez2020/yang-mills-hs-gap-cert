New axiom/estimate templates that strictly imply one blocker.

Axiom A (Uniform IR bound in one channel):
∃ O local gauge-invariant and m_*>0 such that the connected correlator of O decays as e^{-m_*|x|}.
Implies (1) exponential clustering immediately.

Axiom B (Uniform spectral floor under RG):
∃ Λ0,m_*>0 such that I(Λ) ≥ m_* for all Λ≥Λ0.
Implies (3) and gives mass gap in the continuum limit.

Axiom C (Ball coercivity with uniform constants):
∃ R0,m_loc>0 such that ball coercivity holds for all R≥R0.
Together with IMS (localization error→0) implies global gap.

Each axiom is a single checkable inequality; any one closes the remainder thread.
