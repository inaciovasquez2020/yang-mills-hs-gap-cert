# RIB — RG–Interaction Bridge (Minimal Missing Lemma)

Statement (operator-level bridge):
  ∃ κ>0, γ>0, and remainder r_{Λ,E} such that for all large Λ and small E>0,

  || P_{≤E} ( ∂_{log Λ} H_Λ + κ H_int(Λ) ) P_{≤E} || ≤ r_{Λ,E},

  with
    r_{Λ,E} = O((log Λ)^-(1+ε)) + o(E^γ)
  (uniform in Λ on bounded ranges).

Role:
  Converts WIF into a smallness bound on ||P_{≤E} H_int P_{≤E}||, contradicting IRI
  unless the low-energy sector is vacuum-only, yielding a uniform gap.
